/**
 * In-memory per-IP rate limiter for the paid (LLM / embedding / Hive) routes.
 *
 * Why in-memory and not Postgres/Redis: `feed-web` runs pinned at
 * minScale=maxScale=1, so there is exactly one Node process. A module-level Map
 * is therefore a *global* counter shared across all concurrent requests — no
 * shared store is needed. This is correct ONLY while the service stays at a
 * single instance; if maxScale is ever raised above 1 the limit multiplies
 * per-instance and this must move to shared state (Cloud SQL / Redis) or
 * Cloud Armor at an external load balancer.
 *
 * State resets on each deploy/restart — fine for short rate-limit windows. The
 * provider-side spend caps (Anthropic spend limit, GCP budget, Vertex quota,
 * Hive cap) remain the authoritative bill ceiling; this limiter only blunts
 * casual scripted abuse before it reaches those caps.
